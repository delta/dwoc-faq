## Learning experience

-   Not only do you get to hone your coding skills, you will also learn a lot more about working collaboratively while receiving one-on-one mentorship.
-   Whether you are a beginner or an active coder, there is a project for everyone. You will get to explore new technologies and get involved in the open source culture.

## Building your network

Through DWoC, you get to meet like-minded people passionate about technology who you can discuss ideas with, try fun projects and receive constructive feedback from.

## Love for Code

If you enjoy coding and feel passionate about writing good quality code and building great software, DWoC is THE place for you to give way to your passion.

## Experience

-   The DWoC follows a process similar to Google Summer of Code. Past DWoC'ers have moved on to be successful in completing GSoC as well.
-   Contributing to a project all winter gives you the chance to learn about good coding practices, improve on your pull request etiquette, and so much more!

(And we have goodies!)
