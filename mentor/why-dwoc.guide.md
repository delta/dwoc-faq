## Why Mentor a Project?

Delta Winter of Code receives 400+ registrations every edition.
This is our first time opening mentorship to external organizations.

- After your project gets selected, it will be showcased on our site. It will help your project
   - get required features added,
   - issues discovered, and
   - give you experience in managing a project in a larger scale.

- There are numerous benefits to making a project open-source, some of which are explained at https://opensource.google/docs/why

- Our process is very similar to that of Google Summer of Code.
    - Many students who completed DWoC have been selected in GSoC.
    - One of the previous mentors went on to mentor a project in GSoC as well!

- All accepted mentors will also receive goodies from DWoC!

So what's stopping you? Register your project today!
