## Mentors guide

Mentorship is a serious commitment but a very rewarding experience. 

Mentors are people from the community who volunteer to work with a student. They provide guidance which includes but is not limited to code reviews, pointers to useful documentation, clearing doubts, etc. In addition to providing students with feedback and pointers, a mentor acts as an ambassador to help the student contributor(s) integrate into their project’s community.

### The Application Process
- The application process could be more tedious than the contributing period as the applicants are new to the projects and might need guidance in understanding it.
- As part of the final application, applicants are asked to build a tentative timeline for their project. It is advised that the mentors have a rough idea of the series of tasks for their project.
- Both the mentors and applicants may also adjust project goals based on what the applicant is interested in, or if the applicant needs more time to learn a skill or tool. Mentors should be open to adjusting project timelines.

Make sure that your student is familiar with the workflow of your community as early as possible. Learning the toolchain a project uses, such as libraries, version control systems and bugtrackers, is high priority. Workflow also encompasses code review, talking with other developers about which algorithm is best for the problem at hand and other meta-questions about how to best get from specification to implemented solution.
