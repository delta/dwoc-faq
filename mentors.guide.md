## Mentors guide

Mentorship is a serious commitment but a very rewarding experience. Mentors are people from the community who volunteer to work with a student. Mentors provide guidance such as pointers to useful documentation, code reviews, etc. In addition to providing students with feedback and pointers, a mentor acts as an ambassador to help student contributors integrate into their project’s community. 
The application process could be more tedious than the contributing period as the applicants are new to the projects and might need guidance in understanding the project. As part of the final application, applicants are asked to build a tentative timeline for their project. Mentors should have a rough idea of the series of tasks for their project. Project timelines are often adjusted during the contribution period. Sometimes that's because a task took longer than a mentor expected. Mentors and applicants may also adjust project goals based on what the applicant is interested in, or if the applicant needs more time to learn a skill or tool. Mentors should be open to adjusting project timelines.

 - Reviewing applicant contributions and being able to respond to applicant questions promptly.
 - Tracking your mentee’s progress.
