### Now that you're all prepped up, let's dive into DWoC and how you can work on an open source project!
- We recommend identifying a language or framework you're comfortable with.
- Go through the various organizations on the site and find what best suits your interests.
- Go through the projects under each organization and see what you'd like to work on.
- Join the channels of the organization so you can interact with the mentors, get more information and get all your doubts or queries regarding the project clarified.
-  Create a proposal for the project. A proposal is a written document where you talk about what you've done so far and why you should be given this project.This can include making small contributions to existing codebase, identifying issues, coming up with an implementation to the project put up, your past works as examples etc
-  Mentors choose whom to give the projects to based on the proposals submitted on the site.
-  Selected participants spend their winter contributing and being mentored.
-  Upon completion, all participants are awarded.

We hope this encourages you to code, explore and work with people in our community.
